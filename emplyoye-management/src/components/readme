The Employee Directory Project employs a combination of TypeScript and React for building a dynamic and type-safe user interface. Key functionalities include a form for adding new employees, leveraging the useState hook to manage form input and submission state. The form captures essential employee details (ID, Name, Role, Department, Join Date, and Image URL), utilizing controlled components for input handling and validation to ensure required fields are filled out correctly.

The project implements a functional component structure, with separate components for the employee registration form (NewEmployeeForm), employee display cards (EmployeeCard), search functionality (EmployeeSearch), and the employee grid layout (EmployeeGrid). The search feature allows users to filter the displayed employees based on their names by utilizing the filter method on the employee array, enabling a responsive user experience.

Styling is achieved through Bootstrap, enhancing the application's appearance with responsive design and predefined classes for layout and component styling. The logic for toggling the visibility of the registration form is managed through a simple state variable, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
